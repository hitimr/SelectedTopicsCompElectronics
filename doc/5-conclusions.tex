\section{Conclusions}
The benchmark shows that NanoVDB runs approx. 1.5x as fast as OpenVDB on the same CPU in a hypothetical level-set raytracing scenario within the context of semiconductor process simulation.
Launching the NanoVDB kernel on a comparable GPU achieves approx. 6.2x faster performance than OpenVDB.
However in its current form NanoVDB is strictly limited to voxel-level accuracy and performs no additional steps to increase the accuracy of level set raytracing intersections.

Migrating code from OpenVDB to NanoVDB requires significant changes to the codebase.
Therefore if GPUs are to be utilize if might be more efficient to choose NanoVDB and only convert to OpenVDB when needed.

A preliminary analysis of NanoVDBs code shows that improvements to performance are be possible.
Furthermore recent benchmarks by independent researchers have shown that NVIDIAs new raytracing technology (RTX) may increase performance.
However it is currently not known if NanoVDB is compatible with this technology.
